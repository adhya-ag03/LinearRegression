Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that describes this relationship.   

Simple Linear Regression
When there's only one independent variable, we call it simple linear regression. The equation for a simple linear regression model is:

y = mx + b
y: Dependent variable
x: Independent variable
m: Slope of the line (coefficient of the independent variable)
b: Intercept (constant term)
The goal is to find the values of m and b that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (based on the line) and the actual values. This is known as the least squares method.

Multiple Linear Regression
When there are multiple independent variables, it's called multiple linear regression. The equation extends to:

y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn
b0: Intercept
bi: Coefficient for the ith independent variable
xi: ith independent variable
Assumptions of Linear Regression
Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.
Independence: The observations are independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals (errors) is constant across all levels of the independent variable.   
Normality: The residuals are normally distributed.
Applications of Linear Regression
Linear regression has a wide range of applications, including:

Predicting sales: Predicting future sales based on factors like marketing spend and economic indicators.
Analyzing stock prices: Understanding the relationship between stock prices and economic factors.
Evaluating employee performance: Predicting employee performance based on factors like experience and education.
Medical research: Analyzing the relationship between risk factors and disease outcomes.
